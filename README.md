# CS50AI Projects

Welcome to my CS50AI Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of the CS50AI course offered by Harvard University. Each project explores various artificial intelligence concepts and techniques learned throughout the course.

# Projects

## Search

### Degrees of Separation
The Degrees of Separation project focuses on implementing search algorithms to find the shortest path of connections between two individuals in a social network. Using breadth-first search (BFS), I developed an algorithm to explore the network and determine the shortest chain of connections between any two individuals.

### Tic-Tac-Toe
The Tic-Tac-Toe project involves creating an AI agent capable of playing the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Using minimax algorithm, I developed an AI player that can analyze the game state and make optimal moves to maximize its chances of winning or achieving a draw. The project required implementing game mechanics, evaluating board states, and designing an efficient search algorithm to explore possible moves.

## Knowledge

### Knights
The Knights problem involves creating a program that solves logic puzzles involving characters who are either knights (truth-tellers) or knaves (liars). By encoding the given statements of characters and applying propositional logic, AI must determine the identity of each character based on the truthfulness of their statements. This problem emphasizes the application of logical reasoning and model checking algorithms to deduce solutions to complex puzzles within a grid-based environment.

### Minesweeper
The Minesweeper problem focuses on creating an AI program capable of playing the Minesweeper game. By representing each cell as a propositional variable and applying logical reasoning, the AI must determine safe moves and identify mines within the game grid. This project emphasizes the application of knowledge-based agents and inference techniques to effectively navigate and solve Minesweeper puzzles.

## Uncertainty

### PageRank
The PageRank project implements an algorithm used by search engines like Google to determine the importance of web pages. This algorithm, named after Google co-founder Larry Page, ranks pages based on the number of incoming links they receive from other pages. However, it addresses the issue of artificially inflating a page's importance by considering the importance of the linking pages. This iterative algorithm assigns higher importance to pages linked by other important pages, thereby providing a more accurate measure of a page's significance amidst the uncertainty of web navigation behavior.

### Heredity
The Heredity project focuses on predicting the likelihood of genetic traits being inherited within a family. By analyzing genetic data from family members and understanding the rules of inheritance, the program predicts the likelihood of certain traits being passed down through generations. This project delves into probabilistic models for genetic inheritance, Bayesian networks, and conditional probability to model uncertain information. It addresses the uncertainty inherent in genetic inheritance, providing probabilistic estimations rather than definitive answers due to the complexity of genetic interactions and inheritance patterns.
