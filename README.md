# CS50AI Projects

Welcome to my CS50AI Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of the CS50AI course offered by Harvard University. Each project explores various artificial intelligence concepts and techniques learned throughout the course.

## Projects

### Search

#### Degrees of Separation
**Description**: The Degrees of Separation project focuses on implementing search algorithms to find the shortest path of connections between two individuals in a social network. Using breadth-first search (BFS), I developed an algorithm to explore the network and determine the shortest chain of connections between any two individuals.

#### Tic-Tac-Toe

**Description**: The Tic-Tac-Toe project involves creating an AI agent capable of playing the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Using minimax algorithm, I developed an AI player that can analyze the game state and make optimal moves to maximize its chances of winning or achieving a draw. The project required implementing game mechanics, evaluating board states, and designing an efficient search algorithm to explore possible moves.
